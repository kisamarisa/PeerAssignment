##AVERAGE HUMAN ACTIVITIES DATASET
==================================================================
Calculated from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones  
Dataset Version 1.0
Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory
DITEN - Universita degli Studi di Genova.


==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers  
within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six  
activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING,  
STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the  
waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured  
3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a  
constant rate of 50Hz. 

##For each record it is provided:
======================================

* "id" - identification number of experiment participants, passes  
numeric values from 1 to 30.

* "activity" - six activity names, performed in the experiment  
(takes string values : WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS,  
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING.

* "activity_code" - class labels of activity names (takes numeric  
values from 1 to:6):
1 -          WALKING,
2 -  WALKING_UPSTAIRS,
3 - WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS,
4 -           SITTING,
5 -          STANDING,
6	-           LAYING.

* average features for each activity and each experiment  
participant  (66 variables). For these averages calculation mean  
values and standard deviations of listed below features were  
employed:

tBodyAcc-XYZ

tGravityAcc-XYZ

tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
